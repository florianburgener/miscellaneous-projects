Number of runs used to calculate the average execution time : 20

Maximum value of the largest prime number, if it exists: 1,000,000

| Algorithm name        | Average execution time |
|-----------------------|------------------------|
| Algorithm 1           | 856.6059 ms            |
| Algorithm 2           | 510.1347 ms            |
| Sieve of Eratosthenes | 98.9218 ms             |

* Algorithm 2 is faster than Algorithm 1 by a factor of 1.68.
* Sieve of Eratosthenes is faster than Algorithm 2 by a factor of 5.16.
* Sieve of Eratosthenes is faster than Algorithm 1 by a factor of 8.66.

These results are inaccurate because other maximum values should be tested in order to reach a relevant conclusion. Taking this into account, it is clear that Sieve of Eratosthenes is the best algorithm, but it is very memory-intensive.
